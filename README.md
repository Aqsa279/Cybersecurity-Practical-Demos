# Cybersecurity-Practical-Demos
“A collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs and demos created for learning and skill demonstration.”
This demo is performed on self-created passwords in a local lab environment for learning purposes only.

## Password Hashing Demo (MD5)

### Objective
To demonstrate how passwords are converted into hashes and why systems do not store plain text passwords.

### Tools Used
- Python
- hashlib library
- MD5 hashing algorithm

### Environment
- Local machine
- Educational lab setup

### Steps
1. User enters a password
2. Password is converted into MD5 hash
3. System stores only the hash
4. Login is verified by comparing hashes

### What I Learned
- How hashing works
- Why weak passwords are risky
- Importance of stronger hashing algorithms

⚠️ This demo is for learning purposes only using self-created passwords.
